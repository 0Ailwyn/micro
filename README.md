# Micro
Home for a microservices protocol and suite of language agnostic tooling

## Premise
Microservices is an architecture pattern used to decompose a single large application in to a smaller suite of services. Generally the goal is to create light weight services of 1000 lines of code or less. Each service alone provides a particular focused solution or set of solutions. These small services can be used as the foundational building blocks in the creation of a larger system.

The concept of microservices is not new, this is the reimagination of service orientied architecture but with an approach more holistically aligned with unix processes and pipes. For those of us with extensive experience in this field we're somewhat biased and feel this is an incredibly beneficial approach to system design at large and developer productivity.

The goal of **Micro** is to try introduce the concept of microservices to the developer community and start a conversation around a protocol of sorts. Hopefully this will allow us to come to a consensus on requirements and begin writing libraries in every language so this architecture pattern can be used by anyone and everyone.

It's still early days but a proof of concept library has been started in Go which can be found at [github.com/asim/go-micro](https://github.com/asim/go-micro)

## Requirements

The foundation of a library enabling microservices is based around the following requirements:

- Server - an ability to define handlers and serve requests 
- Client - an ability to make requests to another service
- Discovery - a mechanism by which to discover other services

These 3 components form the minimum requirements for microservices development. An ecosystem of libraries and tools can be created around them to provide a feature rich system however at the foundation only these 3 things are required to write services and communicate between them.

### Server

The server is the core component which allows you to register request handlers and serve requests. Ideally it's transport agnostic so different transports such as http, rabbitmq, etc can be chosen. On start it should register itself with discovery system so other microservices know it exists and deregister when shutting down. The server should handle encoding/decoding incoming/outgoing requests, leaving the handlers to operate on the request/response types they expect.

Example interface:
```
server.New(name, options) - instantiate new server
server.Register(handler) - register a handler with the server
server.Start() - start
server.Stop() - stop
```
### Client

Where the server allows you to serve requests, the client lets you make them to other servers. The client should support request/response and pub/sub. Part of the microservices world is event driven programming, taking action based on events, which is why pub/sub is a requirement of the client. It should also make use of the discovery system so requests can be made by service name. 

Example interface:
```
client.Request(name, request) - Make a request to another server
client.Publish(topic, message) - Publish a message on a topic
client.Subscribe(topic, channel) - Subscribe to a topic
```
### Discovery

The discovery system is really vital to microservices development. Any sort of communication between servers will first require locating it and then making the request. Discovery should support registration and retrieval of servers. It should optionally support a keepalive mechanism to remove stale servers.

Example interface:
```
discovery.Register(name, hostname, ...) - Register a server
discovery.Deregister(name, hostname, ...) - Deregister a server
discovery.Get(name) - Get the details for a server
discovery.List() - List all servers
```

## Current Tools
[go-micro](https://github.com/asim/go-micro) - A client/service library based on http-rpc protobuf
[micro-api](https://github.com/asim/micro-api) - A lightweight proxy for Micro based services
[micro-mq](https://github.com/asim/micro-mq) - A simple experimental pub/sub service for testing.

## Example Services
[geo-srv](https://github.com/asim/geo-srv) - A go-micro based geolocation tracking service using hailocab/go-geoindex
