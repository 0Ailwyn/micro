Micro is a microservices toolkit. It simplifies writing and running distributed applications.

Check out [**go-micro**](https://github.com/micro/go-micro) if you want to start writing services in Go now. Examples of how to write services in other languages can be found in [examples/greeter](https://github.com/micro/micro/tree/master/examples/greeter).

Learn more about Micro in the introductory blog post [https://blog.micro.mu/2016/03/20/micro.html](https://blog.micro.mu/2016/03/20/micro.html).

# Overview
The goal of **Micro** is to provide a toolkit for microservice development and management. At the core, micro is simple and accessible enough that anyone can easily get started writing microservices. As you scale to hundreds of services, micro will provide the fundamental tools required to manage a microservice environment.

**Go Micro** - A pluggable RPC framework for writing microservices in Go. It provides libraries for 
service discovery, client side load balancing, encoding, synchronous and asynchronous communication.

**API** - An API Gateway that serves HTTP and routes requests to appropriate micro services. 
It acts as a single entry point and can either be used as a reverse proxy or translate HTTP requests to RPC.

**Web** - A web dashboard and reverse proxy for micro web applications. We believe that 
web apps should be built as microservices and therefore treated as a first class citizen in a microservice world. It behaves much the like the API 
reverse proxy but also includes support for web sockets.

**Sidecar** - The Sidecar provides all the features of go-micro as a HTTP service. While we love Go and 
believe it's a great language to build microservices, you may also want to use other languages, so the Sidecar provides a way to integrate 
your other apps into the Micro world.

**CLI** - A straight forward command line interface to interact with your micro services. 
It also allows you to leverage the Sidecar as a proxy where you may not want to directly connect to the service registry.

## Getting Started

### Writing a service

Learn how to write and run a microservice using [**go-micro**](https://github.com/micro/go-micro). 
Read the [Getting Started](https://github.com/micro/micro/wiki/Getting-Started) guide.

### Install Micro

```shell
$ go get github.com/micro/micro
```

Or via Docker

```shell
$ docker pull microhq/micro
```

### Quick start

We need service discovery, so let's spin up Consul (default discovery mechanism; checkout [go-plugins](https://github.com/micro/go-plugins) to switch it out).

```
$ go get github.com/hashicorp/consul
$ consul agent -dev -advertise=127.0.0.1
```

Run the greeter example app
```shell
$ go get github.com/micro/micro/examples/greeter/server
$ server
```

List services
```shell
$ micro list services
consul
go.micro.srv.greeter
```

Get Service
```shell
$ micro get service go.micro.srv.greeter
go.micro.srv.greeter

Id	Address	Port	Metadata
go.micro.srv.greeter-154a6487-7d7e-11e5-882a-34363b77bace	[::]	57067	

Endpoint: Say.Hello
Metadata: stream=false
Request:
{
	name string
}
Response:
{
	msg string
}

Endpoint: Debug.Health
Metadata: stream=false
Request: {}
Response:
{
	status string
}
```

Query service
```shell
$ micro query go.micro.srv.greeter Say.Hello '{"name": "John"}'
{
	"msg": "go.micro.srv.greeter-154a6487-7d7e-11e5-882a-34363b77bace: Hello John"
}

```

## The Ecosystem

The overarching project [github.com/micro](https://github.com/micro) is a microservice ecosystem which consists of a number of tools and libraries. Each of which can either be used totally independently, plugged into your architecture or combined as a whole to provide a completely distributed systems platform.

It currently consists of the following.

### Go Micro

[Go-micro](https://github.com/micro/go-micro) is a pluggable Go client framework for writing microservices. Go-micro can be used standalone and should be the starting point for writing applications.
